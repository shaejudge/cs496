This was a demo from CS 496.

Basically, it run from the command line or bash shell with "dev_appserver.py app.yaml"
It is then located on localhost:8080 and the admin tools are located on localhost:8000

We mainly used Postman to test GETs and POSTs with the analogy of a fish store.

Some of the stuff, like the parent key and the PUT in the GET, doesn't necessarily make sense in the context of the fish store, but it was used to show different functionality.
